# DungeonLootTracker

I decided to make this when I was running low level instances and kept on getting a lot of low level stuff I didn't want to keep and wanted an easy way of vendoring it.

I did find the [Instance Loot Manager](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/instance-loot-manager "Instance Loot Manager") by [LukasasPlays](https://www.curseforge.com/members/lukasasplays/projects "LukasasPlays") but found that it just added everything I had in my bags and then sold everything in my bags instead of only what I had looted in that instance.

So I decided to have a go at making one myself. Credit goes to LukasasPlays for inspiration on how to go about doing certains parts.
