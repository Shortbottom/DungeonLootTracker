# DungeonLootTracker

I decided to make this when I was running low level instances and kept on getting a lot of low level stuff I didn't want to keep and wanted an easy way of vendoring it.

I did find [Instance Loot Manager](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/instance-loot-manager "Instance Loot Manager") by [LukasasPlays](https://www.curseforge.com/members/lukasasplays/projects "LukasasPlays") but found that because of the way it detects what you have looted it doesn't play well with the bag add on I was using. So I decided to make my own that would work how I wanted it to.

So I decided to have a go at making one myself, this is my first time making and add on so it's a good learning curve.
